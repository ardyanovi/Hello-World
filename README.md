# Hello-World
Hi. this is the first anlytical data project of mine that is shared in online platform.
The project is about clustering country in G20 based on social economy indicator of each country, by using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
The analysis calculated in R. You can find the R script in file "PCA.Rhistory".
